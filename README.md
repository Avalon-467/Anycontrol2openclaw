# Anycontrol2openclaw
AnyControl is a lightweight, secure framework designed to transform your personal computer into a stateful, "memory-capable" Agent API. By leveraging the power of OpenClaw, this project bridges the gap between your local hardware and the global internet, enabling seamless remote orchestration from any corner of the world.
Key Capabilities
The PC as an API: Wrap your local environment into a standardized, Gemini-compatible API. Your computer no longer just sits on a desk; it becomes a programmable agent capable of executing complex tasks with contextual memory.

Universal Command-Line Control: Manage your PC using standard terminal tools (like curl) or custom scripts across all mainstream operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Cross-Platform Web Console: A responsive, browser-based interface with multiple UI modes (Chat, Doc, Terminal) and full Markdown support, allowing for intuitive interaction from mobile devices or desktops.

High Security: Features industrial-grade security with HTTPS/TLS encryption, ensuring that only you hold the keys to your agent.
